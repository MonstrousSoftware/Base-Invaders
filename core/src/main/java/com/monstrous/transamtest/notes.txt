- to fix: front wheel sometimes turns very fast - fixed by removing stops on front wheels
- to fix: car collision box is not well aligned
- assert error at com.github.antzGames.gdx.ode4j.ode.internal.joints.DxJointHinge2.makeV1andV2(DxJointHinge2.java:260)
- to do : keep shadow light close to view
- keep camera behind car, zoom out when going fast
