To get CascadeShadows use gdxGltfVersion=-SNAPSHOT instead of 2.1.0 which is the latest release.


Fixed Assert error
- assert error at com.github.antzGames.gdx.ode4j.ode.internal.joints.DxJointHinge2.makeV1andV2(DxJointHinge2.java:260)
This was due to a bug in ODE4j checkign if axis1 == axis2 but not axis1 == -axis2 before calculating cross vectors.
It was fixed by having the same direction for all wheels (the model was made symmetrical).

Disabled FBO because the vignette is not worth the aliasing.

PointSpriteParticleBatch uses
		Gdx.gl.glEnable(GL20.GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE); which gives a warning in WebGL
