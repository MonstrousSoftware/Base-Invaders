- done: front wheel sometimes turns very fast - fixed, clamp delta to reasonable value
- done: car collision box is not well aligned

done : keep shadow light close to view
done- keep camera behind car, zoom out when going fast
done- larger terrain, e.g. tiles & culling
done: hungry owl
- light to highlight eg alien tech
- juicy text-overs
done - ufo path
- enemy vehciles Car subclass
- shooting
- score, driving overhead
- do we want fog?
done- map oriented with car

done- minimap position
done- minimap transparent, rotate
done- bigger terrain
done- gear shift more smoothly
done- roll over, wheelies
done- move jeeps


To get CascadeShadows use gdxGltfVersion=-SNAPSHOT instead of 2.1.0 which is the latest release.


Fixed Assert error
- assert error at com.github.antzGames.gdx.ode4j.ode.internal.joints.DxJointHinge2.makeV1andV2(DxJointHinge2.java:260)
This was due to a bug in ODE4j checkign if axis1 == axis2 but not axis1 == -axis2 before calculating cross vectors.
It was fixed by having the same direction for all wheels (the model was made symmetrical).

Disabled FBO because the vignette is not worth the aliasing.

PointSpriteParticleBatch uses
		Gdx.gl.glEnable(GL20.GL_VERTEX_PROGRAM_POINT_SIZE); which gives a warning in WebGL
